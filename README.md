# Signup form - React.js example

I made this html5/react app for Digia.

## Live build on the internet
You can test the app here: http://jurvakainen.azurewebsites.net/

## Installation guide
Clone the repository. Open command line and go to the project folder. Say\
<code>npm install</code>\
This installs node_modules. After that you can run the app with\
<code>npm start</code>\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the running app in the browser

## About code
